When I work as the TA of a Java class at SCU, my difficulty was that after downloading students' assignments, 
the java file name changed  to a longer name that doesn't match with the class Name. 
For example, we ask student to name their class and java file meiyuanliHW1, it will become meiyuanli_18571_1487247_MeiyuanliHw1.java automatically upon submitting. 
It's very time consuming to change everybody's file name and compile them one by one. 
So, I just wrote a shell script to speed up the process.It's not long but it's super powerful. 
I think this represents why we code in the first place, because we want to make our life easier.



// read the files and strip those we don't need
files=*.java
for f in $files
do
	# echo $f
    # name=$(echo $f | cut -d'.' -f 1)
    # subName=$(echo $name | rev | cut -d'_' -f 1 | rev)
    # mv $f "$subName.java"

    className=$(awk '/public class/ {print $3}' $f)
    mv $f "$className.java"
done

// Compile all java files
javac *.java
javaClasses=*.class
for class in $javaClasses
do
    echo $class
    className=$(echo $class | cut -d'.' -f 1)
    java $className < input.txt
    echo '\n'
done
